# C4 - Code Quiz

## Description
This project was to create a coding quiz with javascript questions. The quiz has a timer of 75s once the start button is pressed and the quiz begins. There are 5 questions in total with 4 different multiple choice buttons. Once one answers, below the multiple choice it logs whether the user answered the previous question correctly or incorrectly. When incorrect, the timer is reduced 10s but when correct, it is counted on local storage. Once all the questions are answered, the user's score appears and the user is asked to input their initials. Then, the user can see other user's scores and initials. The user then can clear the history and/or go back to the info page.
